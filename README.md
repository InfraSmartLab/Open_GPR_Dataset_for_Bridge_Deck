# Open GPR Dataset for Bridge Deck

## Overview
This repository provides a simulated Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) dataset for automated rebar detection in bridge deck inspections. The dataset was generated using gprMax, an open-source GPR simulation tool, to create realistic radargrams representing various bridge deck conditions.

## Dataset Description
	â€¢ Total Samples: 20,000 simulated GPR scans
	â€¢ Simulation Tool: gprMax
	â€¢ Variations Included:
		â€¢ Different antenna frequencies
		â€¢ Various rebar configurations and spacing
		â€¢ Material property variations
		â€¢ Augmentations: Direct wave suppression, noise addition, and Gaussian blur
	â€¢ Annotations: Bounding box labels for hyperbolic features corresponding to rebar, annotated using Labelme 5.5

## Applications
	â€¢ Deep learning-based object detection (YOLO models)
	â€¢ Automated bridge deck assessment
	â€¢ Infrastructure monitoring and non-destructive testing (NDT)
