# Open GPR Dataset for Bridge Deck

## Overview
This repository provides an open-source Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) dataset for automated rebar detection in bridge deck inspections. The dataset includes both real-world and simulated GPR scans, supporting deep learning applications for infrastructure assessment.

## Dataset Description
	â€¢ Real GPR Data: 2,255 images collected from four bridges using different GPR systems and antenna frequencies.
	â€¢ Simulated GPR Data: 20,000 radargrams generated using gprMax, covering various material properties, rebar configurations, and noise conditions.
	â€¢ Annotations: Bounding box annotations of hyperbolic features corresponding to rebar signatures, labeled using Labelme 5.5.
	â€¢ Augmentation: Includes data variations such as direct wave suppression, noise addition, and Gaussian blur to enhance model robustness.

## Applications
	â€¢ Deep learning-based object detection (YOLO models)
	â€¢ Automated bridge deck assessment
	â€¢ Infrastructure monitoring and non-destructive testing (NDT)
